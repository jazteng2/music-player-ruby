custom code - problems with gui_music_player.rb
COUPLING
1. modules/classes
	
	a. data is not shared or changed
	b. data is only related in main window
	c. coupling

	e.g. Buttons return buttons with locations,
	where as Album_store deals only with its own file
	and returns data from that file but not data in 
	Buttons class or any module

	d. main window, 

CHANLENGES
1. button clashes with other buttons

	Problem: 
	variable initially nil, btn pressed
	before event of variable assigned to array
	therefore allowing to get element

	fixes:
	use time delay for each btn click and quickly set 
	it to zero at update. (used, update_interval)

2. modular btns
	
	Problem:
	
	a. created buttons classes for each track and album
	b. problem rises when adding playlist feature because
	it would increase the code as there was no usable btn creator
	
	fixes:
	
	a. set two variables for left panel and right panel for view
	of btns either playlist, track or albums
	b. give parameters id panel side and number of items to display
	c. return coordinates of buttons (fixed width and height)

3. pstore yaml
	
	Problem:
	
	a. values not printing properly in gui
	b. data not seperated
	c. best way to pair playlist to tracks
	d. get the tracks and location individually to display

	fixes:

	a. seperate playlist titles from data

4. add tracks
	
	Problem:
	
	btn -> data -> display
	
	a. reuse display all track (get track data)
	b. reuse button track
	c. reuse highlight
	b. reuse indicate selected button
	d. get data/display data when done
	e. store data
